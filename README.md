# Overfitting and Underfitting

[This Jupyter Notebook](Overfitting_Underfitting.ipynb) is a small experiment I did to solidify my knowlege of gradient descent and curve-fitting. 
It follows the example for overfitting and underfitting in Bishop (2006) Patter Recognition and Machine Learning by learning the coefficients of a polynomial using data points generated by a sine wave with some added Gaussian noise.
