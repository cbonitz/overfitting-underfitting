# Overfitting and Underfitting

[This Jupyter Notebook](Overfitting_Underfitting.ipynb) is a small experiment I did to solidify my knowlege of gradient descent and curve-fitting. 
It follows the example for overfitting and underfitting in [Bishop (2006) Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/) by learning the coefficients of a polynomial using data points generated by a sine wave with some added Gaussian noise.
